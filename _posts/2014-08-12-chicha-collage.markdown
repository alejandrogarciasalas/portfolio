_Generative collages made out of chicha posters_

_Chicha Collage_ is inspired by [Peruvian Chicha Posters](http://creativeroots.org/2012/08/chicha-poster-art-from-peru/), which are characterized by their bold lettering and colorful printing techniques. The cropping, cutting and sorting of the source images is particularly important in this piece, since only fragments are compiled in the collage. All the pictures in a folder are read and assigned to one of several layers. The individual layers have room for experimentation with rotation, position, and size when constructing the collage.
