_This is the third app I published in the Apple Appstore. It is inspired in the pre-inca culture moche. I made this app at the age of 15 and haven't updated it ever since. I took part in the whole process: game design, graphic design (using Adobe Illustrator), level design and development._

"Ai Apaec" the cutthroat God is angry and has stolen the village reliques, now the youngest duckling has taken his defunct grandfather's weapons in order to become their salvation! â€¦ BUT it's not going to be easy at all ... he will have to face different challenges: from Ai Apaec's evil minions up to spikes and flying projectiles! Join "Moch" The Warrior Duck in this fantastic adventure!
