_a tentacles inspired procedural painting_

The direct translation of __*mara単a*__ from Spanish to English is "tangle".

__Note:__ This work of art is part of my collection Paint Brushes. The intention of these experiments is to obtain varied results using a simple principle: users can draw free-form shapes with a predefined generated design, yet the control remains exclusively in the hands of the user. The paint brush provides a connection between the automation of work and the individual ideas and energy of the user.
