_This is the second app I published in the Apple Appstore. I made this app as a challenge to see how fast i could make an app. I finished the app (although imperfect)  in a week. The graphics are nice yet simple. I did this at the age of 14 and haven't updated it ever since. I took part in the whole process: game design, graphic design (using Adobe Illustrator), level design and development._

"non-stop" is a real time puzzle game where the objective is to reach the green squares without hitting any walls, it may seem simple at the beginning but you will eventually see how impossible it can get! And remember we won't be stopping at any time; timing and direction are the key for success in this game! immerse yourself now in this beautiful designed world, a must have indeed!
