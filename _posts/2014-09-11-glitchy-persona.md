_A glitch in the system?_

A glitch in informatics is usually defined as a short-lived fault in a system. It is often used to describe a transient fault that corrects itself, and is therefore difficult to troubleshoot. The "glitch filter" serve as a metaphor for a person that defies the system or status quo in the digital space. This is why in the followin work [Julian Assange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange), [Edward Snowden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden), [Aaron Swartz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz), [Anonymous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_%28group%29) and [The Pirate Bay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay) founders were selected.
